# Class in Python 

A class is a **blueprint for creating objects** — it groups related data (variables) and functions (methods) together so you can **build reusable structures** in your program.

class = variable + functions  => Used to create objects. 

Using **class** we will create the **Objects**.

## Syntax:

```hcl 
    class class_name:
        key=value #define variable if needed

        def function(self):
            print("This is function")   #define the function
```

``hcl 
    To call the class like below:
        print(class_name.function(1))
```

## Why Do We Use Classes?

- To organize code better (clean and structured)
- To reuse functionality without rewriting code
- To model real-world objects (like Car, Student, Employee)
- To group related data + behavior in one place
- To support Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
